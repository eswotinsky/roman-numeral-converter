# _Roman Numeral Converter_

#### _Tool for converting Roman numeral input into Arabic numerals, 01.18.2018_

#### By _**Eric Swotinsky** and **Tyler Wickline**_

## Description

_This program asks users to input a Roman numeral character or string, and returns the equivalent value using Arabic numerals._

**Known Issues:**
* Program does not recognize some invalid Roman numeral constructions as being invalid. E.g. "IIII" will evaluate as "4".
* Program attempts to parse some invalid character pairs, and may do so with unintuitive results. E.g. "IC" will evaluate as "101", rather than "99" or (preferably) as invalid.
